Python notes

SYNTAX

- In comparison with C, python is more similar to the plain english language.
- Python doesnt require semi-colon most of the time.
- In variables, programmer dont have to tell computer what data type is being used. Instead, programming language will interpret it depending on context.
- The f before the double quotes indicates that this is a format string, which will allow us to use curly braces, {}, to include variables that should be substituted, or interpolated. 
- ++ or -- doesnt exist in Python; instead use += or -=
- Conditionals dont require parenthesis (in boolean expressions), instead use colon. Subsequent lines need to be indented. Indetention in Python is IMPORTANT.
- elif replaces else if
- Lists are more like linked lists rather than arrays.
- Python has a function called range that gives you a range of values from 0 on up to, but not through a value. It takes more arguments as well.
- Python doesnt have constants.
- Built-in data types:
    bool, True or False
    float, real numbers
    int, integers which can grow as needed
    str, strings
- Other types in Python include:
    range, sequence of numbers
    list, sequence of mutable values, or values we can change
    tuple, sequence of immutable values
    dict, dictionaries, collection of key/value pairs, like a hash table
    set, collection of unique values, or values without duplicates
- The CS50 library for Python includes functions for getting user input as well:
    get_float
    get_int
    get_string

INTERPRETING CODE

- Python will interpret the language for the programmer; no need to compile it to zeros and ones.
- Instead, you run the code and let computer interpret it.

LIBRARIES

- Python is an Object Oriented Programming Language; it uses objects which encapsulates vales and functions.
